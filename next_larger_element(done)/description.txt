use the deque to store the "waiting elements" using the struct item that contains index and value
-push_front when current < front
-push_back otherwise

for every current element check if it's greater than the front element of deque
if so remove from front and put in the max[item.index] the current value 
repeat until deque empty or front > current
then push current item in deque

at the end for each element remaining in the deque put max[item.index] = -1

every item is inserted and removed 1 times so the com√®lexity is linear.
